# INFO6210_DatabaseDesign

### COURSE DESCRIPTION
Database Design and Implementation introduces database development theory and skills, including database concepts, architecture, and deployment in a user-centered system context using SQL. This course presents many of the valuable skills required for managing, manipulating and analyzing large amounts of data, related to the relational data model, the database system lifecycle (including entity-relationship diagramming and normalization), SQL programming, security and privacy issues, as well as principles of transaction management. NoSQL is also explored.
Students will develop a project database on a business premise of their choosing as well as conduct analyses upon a set of sample data. This course also presents a foundation for more advanced study with database technology; each student will have the opportunity to gain a solid understanding of how database systems are deployed and used within the context of real-world challenges.
### SOFTWARE
SQL Server will be provided in a hosted environment. Students will need to download and install SQL Server Management Studio to connect to it. Students can also install the complete SQL Server software on their computers. The Developer Edition of SQL Server 2012/14/16 is recommended. In addition to SQL Server, MS Visio 2010 Professional is required.
### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Upon successfully completing the course, students will be able to conduct the following:
- describe the rationale for designing and deploying database management systems
- explain the differences between Relational Database Management Systems and NoSQL Database Management Systems
- communicate the various forms of data integrity (domain, entity and referential)
- define the process of developing a fully-normalized database design
- explain the structural components of databases (entities, attributes, data types & indexes)
- perform queries and analysis of data using SQL programming language
- articulate concepts of ACID properties and principles of transaction management
- describe legal and ethical issues related to data privacy and ownership
### DATABASE PROJECT
Students will form teams of 3 and develop a relational database based on reading and class lectures. 
#### Team Formation, Database Topic and Mission Statement/Objectives
Form a team of three members. Each team will collaborate to decide a database topic. The database topics may be like Book Store, University Registration, etc. Each team will also establish the mission statement and identify the mission objectives that the database will accomplish. The mission objectives may be like Book Sale, Inventory Control, etc.
#### Database Design and Initial ERD
Based on reading and class lectures, each team will create an initial Entity-Relationship diagram (ERD) that depicts a database for a real or fictitious business. This database will allow for data collection, processing, and reporting for a particular organization. It is strongly suggested that each team model a database for a type of organization that they have relatively deep understanding---such as the current or previous work experience or perhaps a personal hobby. In the past, students have created databases to capture data about video rental stores, bike repair shops, beer tasting/review professionals, athletic leagues, and airlines. Students are encouraged to use their imagination!
Each team will submit an ERD for the database of their choosing. The target for the initial ERD is 12 entities or more. In addition to the ERD, students should submit a database design document containing the description of the business problems being addressed by their database, list all entities and how they are related to each other, and key design decisions.
For the part of the business problems being addressed, this section could be similar to the mission objective document completed earlier. Additionally and more importantly, this document should contain your team's key database design decisions, such as why an entity is included and how that entity is related to other entities.
#### Final ERD
Based on the instructor’s feedback of the initial ERD, each team will make improvements to the initial ERD. Most likely, these changes will be in regards to further ‘normalization’ of the database entities, reducing redundant data, and recognizing additional entities.
In addition to submitting a fine-tuned ERD, each team will also submit a brief description identifying the changes made to the initial ERD. It is also important to update the design document to reflect the new design changes. Resubmission of the updated design document is not required at this time.
#### Database Implementation
Each team will submit the ‘SQL code’ to implement the database design as well as enter a minimal amount of data (at least 10 rows for each table) using the SQL INSERT scripts, Data Import Wizard, and/or stored procedures. Specific objects to be reflected in the code include the database, tables, data types, primary and foreign keys, and views. Each team is expected to create at least 2 views (often used for reporting purposes).
The implementation must include at least two of the following three items:
- Table-level CHECK Constraints
- Computed Columns based on a function
- Column Data Encryption
